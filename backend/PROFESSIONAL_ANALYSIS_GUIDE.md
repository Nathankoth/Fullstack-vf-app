analysis = generate_real_estate_analysis(
    metrics={
        'cap_rate': 0.06,
        'cash_on_cash': 0.08,
        'noi': 1200000,

    },
    currency_symbol="₦",
    region="Nigeria"
)
```

### **AI Integration**
```python
# Enhanced AI prompts with calculated metrics
prompt = f"""

Do NOT use markdown, asterisks, or hashtags.
Write in clean, human-like language as if by a financial analyst.
